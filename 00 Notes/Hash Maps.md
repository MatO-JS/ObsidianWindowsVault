# Hash Maps or Hash tables


Hash maps or tables  is a data structure that store key-value pairs. Objects and maps in js are implementations of hash table.

Hash table is a collection of key value pairs. These are stored in an array. The keys of the hash table needs to be converted to a numeric index  in order to store the values in the array. This is done by a hashing function which converts the keys to a hash code which is mapped to a numeric index which is with in the bounds of the array. The values are stored against these indexes.

set() is used to add 
get() is used to retrieve
remove() is used to delete
