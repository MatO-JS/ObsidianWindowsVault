### Objects

An object is a collection of key value pairs

```js
const person = {
firstName : "Bruece",
lastName : "Wayne"
}
```

if you want to insert or remove a property from an object the time complexity is constant.

Insert - O(1)
Remove - O(1)
Access - O(1 )

No matter how many properties exist in an object it takes the same amount of time to insert or remove a property from an object.

Search - O(n)

For searching for a key in an object the time complexity is linear. To find a property in an object in the worst case scenario we have to search all the properties in the object.

For methods of an object
```js
Object.keys() -  O(n) //return an array of all the keys
Object.values() - O(n) //return an array of all the values)
Object.entries() =O(n)
```

### Arrays

An array is a ordered collection of values

```js
const odd = [1,3,5,7,9]
```

Insert / remove at end - O(1)

Insert / remove at beginning - O(n) 
This is because the index of every other element of the array should be rearranged after removal from the beginning.

Access - O(1)
Search - O(n)
push / pop - O(1)
shift / unshift / concat / slice / splice - O(n)
forEach / map / filter / reduce - O(n)
