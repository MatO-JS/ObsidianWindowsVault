# Algorithm analysis

There are multiple ways to solve one problem. If that is the case how do we analyze which one of the methods is the efficient one ?


The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted , since it depends on a number of factors. It can change based on 

- Programming language used to implement the algorithm
- The computer the program runs on
- Other programs running at the same time
- Quality of the operating system
- and many other factors

   

We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size .The evaluation is of two types

1. Time complexity - Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.   
2. Space Complexity - Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run as function of input size.

By evaluating the input size the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparison is also appropriate.


How to represent the complexity of an algorithm ?

Asymptotic notations - : Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity.There are 3 notations

1. Big-O notation - to represent Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation - Best case complexity
3. Theta Notation - Average case complexity
