## What is an algorithm ? 

An algorithm is a set of well defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

Example of an algorithm

## Consider the case of adding 2 numbers

- inputs : 2 numbers a and b

- logical steps to accomplish this : 
	1. Add numbers using +
	2. Return the value

- output : sum of a and b

## Characteristics of an algorithm

1. Well defined inputs and outputs
2. Each step should be clear and unambiguous
3. Language independent

## Why you should learn about algorithms ?

With algorithms we are learning techniques to **efficiently** solve problems.
