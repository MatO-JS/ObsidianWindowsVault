# Big-O Notation

The worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notation.


## What is Big-O notation ?

Big-O notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms. It has two important characteristics
	- It is expressed in terms of the input size
	- It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details.



## Big-O Time complexity

Program to find the sum of first n numbers

```js

function summation(n) {            ---------------------------> n=4
	let sum = 0; 			----------------------------> 1 time
	for (let i = 1; i<=n; i++) {
		sum = sum+i;	----------------------------> 4 times
	}
	return sum;	------------------------------------> 1 time
}

//Example

	summation(4) = 10;
	1+2+3+4 = 10;
```
To find the time complexity we
 
> **Count the number of times a statement executes based on the input size.**


In the above example , given n=4 lets calculate the number of times each statement is executed.

line 2 executes only once
line 4 executes 4 times
line  6 exectues only 1 time.



The total count is 4+2 =6.We can generalize this  to n+2, where n is the input to the function.If n=4 total count = 4+2.
If n= 10  total count = 10+2
If n = 10000000 then total count = 10000000000 + 2.Here the value of 2 becomes irreleavant.

Here our time complexity is dependent on the input size.ie Big-O is exxpressed in terms of the input size

### Big-O focusses on the bigger picture without getting caughtup in the minute details.

ie if n is very large , then only the input is taken as reference.The +2 i irrelevant.

So time complexity can be notated as O(n) which is refered to as linear time complexity.What this means that as the inputsize increases the time complexity increases(time for execution of the algorithm increases).

Another algorithm to find the sum of n numbers.

```js

function summation(n) {
	return (n * (n + 1))  / 2;
}

```
The time complexity of the above alogrithm is O(1).
This is called constnat Time complexity.   
Irrespective of the value of n line 2 is exectued only once. 


The time complexity of nested loop is O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity. 

For 3 nested loops time complexity O(n^3) - Cubic time complexity

In the Input size reduces by half every iteration it is logarithmic time complexity O(logn) - Logarithmic.

Space complexity

If the algorithm does not need extra memory but the memory needed does not depend on the input size the space complextiy is constant - O(1)

Linear space complexity O(n) - The extra space needed grows as input size grows.

Logarithmic time complexity O(logn) - The extra space needed grows but not as the same pace as the input size.
