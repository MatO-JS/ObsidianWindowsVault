Now you start to understand how Ethereum,  smart contracts and decentralized applications work.  We are getting closer to start coding our first smart contract.  However,  we still need to set up our development environment.  So in this section,  I will introduce you the main development tools we need as a blockchain developer.  And I will show you how to install these tools on your computer.  It can be a bit overwhelming to see quickly so many different tools. This section is only here to give you a high-level overview of these different tools.

 But we will learn more in details how to use them later in this course as we develop our first smart contract and decentralized application.  Let's get started.
