EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode is the low-level, machine-readable code that is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) when running smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The role of EVM bytecode in smart contracts is crucial, as it serves as the intermediary between the high-level programming language (such as Solidity) used to write the smart contract code and the EVM itself.

Here's how EVM bytecode fits into the process of creating and executing smart contracts:

1. **Writing Smart Contract Code**: Developers write smart contract code in a high-level programming language like Solidity. This code is human-readable and easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Compiling to Bytecode**: The Solidity code is then compiled into EVM bytecode using a Solidity compiler. The compiler translates the high-level code into a series of low-level instructions that the EVM can understand and execute.
3. **Deployment on the Blockchain**: When a smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, the EVM bytecode is included in the transaction data and stored on the blockchain. This bytecode represents the immutable and executable version of the smart contract.
4. **Execution by the EVM**: When a user interacts with the deployed smart contract by sending a transaction, the EVM reads and executes the bytecode instructions one by one. The EVM is a stack-based virtual machine that follows a specific set of rules and operations to process the bytecode.

The use of EVM bytecode offers several advantages:

1. **Platform Independence**: EVM bytecode is platform-independent, meaning it can be executed by any Ethereum node running the EVM, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.
2. **Immutability and Transparency**: Since the bytecode is stored on the blockchain, it is immutable and transparent, ensuring that the smart contract's behavior cannot be altered after deployment.
3. **Optimization and Gas Efficiency**: EVM bytecode can be optimized by compilers to reduce the gas cost (computational effort) required to execute the smart contract, making it more efficient and cost-effective.
4. **Security Analysis**: EVM bytecode can be analyzed and audited for potential vulnerabilities and security issues before deployment, helping to ensure the smart contract's integrity and reliability.
5. **Compatibility and Interoperability**: All Ethereum nodes and clients understand and can execute EVM bytecode, ensuring compatibility and interoperability across the Ethereum ecosystem.

While developers write smart contracts in high-level languages like Solidity, the EVM bytecode is the actual code that is executed on the Ethereum blockchain. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the correct execution, immutability, and transparency of smart contracts, as well as enabling platform independence and optimizations for gas efficiency.

### Where is the EVM byte code saved?

The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode of a smart contract is saved on the Ethereum blockchain itself when the contract is deployed.

Here's a more detailed explanation of where and how the EVM bytecode is stored:

1. **Compilation**: When you write a smart contract in a high-level language like Solidity, the code is compiled into EVM bytecode using a compiler like the Solidity compiler.
2. **Deployment Transaction**: To deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain, you need to send a special transaction called a "contract deployment transaction." This transaction contains the compiled EVM bytecode of the smart contract.
3. **Transaction Data**: The EVM bytecode is included in the "data" field of the deployment transaction. This field holds the actual bytecode instructions that the EVM will execute when creating and deploying the smart contract.
4. **Block Storage**: When the deployment transaction is mined and included in a block, the entire transaction data, including the EVM bytecode, is stored permanently on the Ethereum blockchain.
5. **Contract Address**: After a successful deployment, the smart contract is assigned a unique 20-byte address on the Ethereum blockchain. This address is derived from the deployer's address and the transaction nonce (a counter used to prevent replay attacks).
6. **Blockchain Storage**: The EVM bytecode of the deployed smart contract is stored in the state trie (a Merkle Patricia tree data structure) of the Ethereum blockchain, associated with the contract's address.
7. **Immutability**: Once the EVM bytecode is stored on the blockchain, it becomes immutable. This means that the code of the deployed smart contract cannot be modified, ensuring the integrity and transparency of the contract's behavior.

Every full Ethereum node that participates in the network stores a copy of the entire blockchain, including the EVM bytecode of all deployed smart contracts. When a transaction interacts with a specific smart contract, the Ethereum nodes retrieve the corresponding EVM bytecode from the blockchain and execute it in the EVM to process the transaction.

It's important to note that while the EVM bytecode is immutable once deployed, the state variables and data stored within a smart contract can be modified by executing the contract's functions. However, any changes to the state variables are recorded as new transactions on the blockchain, maintaining a transparent and auditable record of the contract's state changes over time.

The storage of EVM bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain ensures the immutability, transparency, and deterministic execution of smart contracts, which are fundamental principles of the Ethereum ecosystem and decentralized applications (DApps).
