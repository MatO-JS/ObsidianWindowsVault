### Explain gas, gas limit and gas price ?

In the Ethereum network, gas, gas limit, and gas price are essential concepts related to transaction fees and the execution of smart contracts. Here's an explanation of each:

1. **Gas**: Gas is the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations on the Ethereum network. Every operation, such as transferring Ether or executing a smart contract function, requires a certain amount of gas. The more complex the operation, the more gas it will consume.
2. **Gas Limit**: The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that a transaction or smart contract execution is allowed to consume. When you send a transaction or execute a smart contract function, you need to specify the gas limit. If the operation consumes more gas than the specified gas limit, the transaction or execution will fail, and any state changes will be reverted (but the gas fee will still be charged).

The gas limit helps prevent accidental or hostile infinite loops or excessive computational workloads, which could potentially bring the network to a halt. It also ensures that miners can accurately estimate the computational effort required to execute a transaction or smart contract function before including it in a block.

3. **Gas Price**: The gas price is the amount of Ether (in Gwei, which is 10^-9 ETH) that you are willing to pay per unit of gas consumed. It's a way to incentivize miners to include your transaction in the next block they mine. Transactions with higher gas prices are typically processed faster by miners since they will receive a higher fee.

The gas price is set by the sender of the transaction or the user executing a smart contract function. If the gas price is too low, your transaction may take a long time to be included in a block, as miners will prioritize transactions with higher gas prices. If the gas price is too high, you may end up paying more than necessary.

The total fee paid for a transaction is calculated by multiplying the gas used by the gas price. For example, if a transaction consumes 50,000 gas and the gas price is 20 Gwei, the total fee would be 50,000 * 20 * 10^-9 ETH = 0.001 ETH.

Setting appropriate gas limits and gas prices is crucial to ensure that transactions are processed efficiently and at a reasonable cost. Most Ethereum wallets and development tools provide recommendations or automatic gas limit and gas price estimation to help users set these values correctly.
