pragma solidity

msg.sender
msg.value
now block.timestamp
```

In this video, I'm going to show you the main building variables of Solidity.

So the first one that you're going to use a lot is
- `msg.sender`
It is the the address of the sender of the transaction. It's impossible to fake that. Thanks to the cryptography of Ethereum, you are sure that MSG sender is populated with the actual sender of a transaction. 
- `msg.value`
It is the Ether that was sent with a transaction. For example, if I send some Ether to the smart contract, then this value will be superior to zero. But you don't have to send some Ether if you just want to execute the function of your smart contract and not send any Ether, then this will be equal to zero.
- `now`
It is  the current timestamp in seconds. If you don't know what is the timestamp, that's basically the number of seconds elapsed since 1st of January 1970. And the reference for that is the <font color="#ffff00">timestamp of the block in which the transaction was mined. </font>There is also a synonym for `now`, it's `block.timestamp`

So these are not the only built-in variables. Here you will find the full list in the documentation of Solidity, I put a link above the video if you're curious about this. But the three ones I show you are really the most useful ones. 

That's it for this video, and in the next video I'll show you the control structures of Solidity.
