## What is a constructor in Solidity ?

>A constructor is a function where you can run some initialization code when you deploy your smart contract. 

The code inside the constructor is only run once when you deploy your smart contract and after that it's never run again. So let's take an example. 

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.0

contract MyContract {
	unit a;
	constructor(unit _a,) public {
	a = _a;
	}
	
}

or
	function MyContract(){ // old now not used
	
	}
```


So let's say that we have a smart contract with an integer variable and we want to give it an initial value when we deploy the smart contract. So we define our constructor with the constructor keyword and it can accept an argument like this and if it accepts several arguments then you give it a comma and then you declare your constructor public then you open the curly braces and inside you give a value to your variable. Another thing to know is that if you read some old tutorial for Solidity you might see another kind of constructor which is defined with the function keyword and the same name of the smart contract. So this was valid in Solidity 0.4 but from Solidity 0.5 and after it was removed. Now you have to use the constructor keyword. That's it for this video. In next video I'll explain you functions in Solidity.
