## Difference b/w cryptocurrencies and Block chain?

Block chain is a neutral technology. <u>Depending on the type of data we store in the bc it can be used for many different purposes</u> . One of the most popular use of block chain technology has been cryptocurrencies. There are many crypto currencies as seen in the website coinMarketCap. Bit coin has a special place among cryptocurrencies(cc) because it is the first cc that introduced the bc technology in 2009.

If you want to have a good understanding of how  bc works it is a good idea to learn bit coin.

Bit coin allows the transfer of a virtual currency that we call bit coin between different addresses. Bit coin addresses are identifiers composed of alphanumeric characters . Each of these addresses is associated to a bitcoin balance. The owner of the address is able to spend his bitcoin and send them to another address. The bc of bitcoin records bit coin transfers in what we call **transaction**.These transactions happen inside blocks and these blocks are linked to each other. If you want to compute the balance of a specific address you have to go through all the blocks of the bc and take into consideration all the relevant transactions. In bit coin the addresses are managed by external software called **wallets**. The bc itself does not have a centralized management of addresses. Everybody is free to create as many addresses as they want with their wallet.
