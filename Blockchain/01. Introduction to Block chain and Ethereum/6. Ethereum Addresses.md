 In Ethereum the role of addresses is to send and receive ether.

#### What are Ethereum addresses ?

###### How Ethereum addresses are created ?

- We start with what we call a **private key**  which is a very long number that is generated randomly. 12358452269685525..... . This private key must be kept a secret like a password. So now we have this secret private key. Then by  using what we  call **Elliptic cryptography** we generate another long number called a **public key**. Using Elliptic cryptography we can go from a private key to public key (128 char) very easily but not the other way around. We compute a cryptographic hash (64 character) of this 128 character long public key using the **Keeccak256**  hash function. In other words we compute a finger print of this public key. This finger print is a string  that is 64 characters long. We take the last 40 characters and prefix it with 0x . In the end we have a string of 42 characters which is your address.

#### What can you do with the address ? 
 - We can give the address to anyone if we want to  receive some ether.
 - We can use the private key that was used to generate the address if we want to send ether to another address. Technically that is called <u>to</u> <u>sign a transaction</u>.

#### Where are these addresses created ? 

The addresses are created in an external software called wallet.
