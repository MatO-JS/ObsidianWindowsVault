Cryptographic hashes are used a lot in bc. For eg: transactions are identified by hash.

##### What is hash ?
A cryptographic hash is a finger print. It uniquely identifies a piece of data. It usually looks like a gibberish string of characters (Aeui894Opw..)  which does not have any meaning. All we care about is it uniquely identifies a piece of data. If we change just one character of the data the hash will be completely different.

### How to produce a hash ?

For this we use a cryptographic hash function like sha2 or sha3. A cryptographic hash function will take any data as input and transform it into a fixed size cryptographic hash as output. The size of input does not matter, the cryptographic hash will always have the same fixed size. Another important feature of ch function is that it is a one way operation. You can go from input to a cryptographic hash(ch) but you cannot go from a ch to an input. That's interesting for privacy for example if you want to represent some data on the bc but don't want to reveal what the data actually is . In Ethereum the hashing function used is   **Keeccak256**.
