## What is a transaction ?

> A transaction is a signed package of data that describes an action that you want to take on the blockchain.


#### Kinds of transactions

 - Transaction to send Ether to another address.
 - Transaction to execute a smart contract.
 - Transaction to create a new smart contract. 

#### Fields of a transaction

 - First, you have the **from** field, that's the address that sends and signs your transaction.
 - Then you have the 'to' field, that's the recipient of the transaction. If you send some Ether to someone, that would be the recipient address. If you execute a smart contract, that would be the address of the smart contract . And if you create a new smart contract, this will be empty.

-  **gas and gas price**. This describes how much you are willing to pay miners in order to include your transaction on the blockchain.
- **Value** field so you will fill it only if you want to send some Ether to someone else. 
- **Data field** so this is used if you want to call a function on a smart contract you will describe which function you want to call and with which arguments.
-  **Nones field** that's optional and this allows you to overwrite a previous transaction.

### Lifecycle of a transaction

- First, your wallet builds the transaction. So it's gonna fill all the fields I described before, from, to, etc.
- Then, the wallet will sign the transaction by using the private key associated to your
- Then, the wallet will send the transaction to the Ethereum blockchain. A miner will pick up the transaction and include it in the next block. This process takes about 15 seconds.
One thing very important to understand here is that it doesn't matter who delivers this transaction to the Ethereum network because if anybody tries to change the content of the transaction or modify the signature, the Ethereum blockchain will pick up on the fact that the transaction is invalid and it will be rejected.
After your transaction is processed by a miner and included in a block, you'll be able to see the side effect of the transaction. So if you send some Ether, you will see the updated balances.
If you executed the function of a smart contract, you'll also be able to see the updated data. And you can inspect that a transaction actually took place by using a blockchain explorer and for Ethereum the most famous one is called Etherscan .
