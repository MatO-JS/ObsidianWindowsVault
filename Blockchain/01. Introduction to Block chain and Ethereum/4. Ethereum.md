 ## Ethereum 

Bit coin was the first bc. It was revolutionary but it was limited. Ethereum was created to overcome the limitation of bitcoin, it was capable not only of handling simple financial transactions but also any any arbitrary computation. This allowed to build more sophisticated application on top of the block chain.


The very core of Ethereum has the same bc technology as in bit coin. In Ethereum bc (ebc) we have a series of blocks and each block have transactions and also we have miners who add new blocks to the Ethereum bc using the POW algorithm. We also have addresses and each Ethereum address is associated to a cryptocurrency(cc) called **ether**  . If you own an address you can transfer your ether to another address. However on top of this basic bc technology there is  is another part called **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**. The EVM is able to run small programs called **smart contracts**. Smart contracts can run code and manipulate ether the cc of Ethereum. For example with smart contracts(sc) we can code a multi signature wallet where you need  the approval of several persons before spending any ether. The beauty of sc is that the code is executed on the bc so you dont need any third party to execute them. Once  the code of the  smart contract is deployed on the bc nobody is able to change the code or stop the sc from running. Its going to run on the bc forever. Another benefit of sc is that it is very hard to hack them.
