In the previous video,  we said that a <font color="#8db3e2">decentralized application is a combination of a user interface and a smart contract.</font>  It feels like a web application,  but there are some differences. 
#### Architecture of a decentralized application. 

- First,  you have a smart contract. <font color="#8db3e2"> This lives on the Ethereum blockchain and that's where you have the data and the business logic of your application</font>.

- Then,  you have a front-end. In the previous video,  I showed you an example with a web front-end that uses HTML,CSS,  and JavaScript.  But it's also possible to have a mobile application for the front-end. 



##### How the front-end will interact with the smart contract?  

- First,  we need to build and sign a transaction. 
- The front-end will provide the parameters of the transaction,  pass it to an Ethereum wallet, Most dApps interface with Metamask,  the browser extension that I mentioned in the last video. 
- Metamask will prompt the user to approve the transaction.  That's the pop-up that showed up in the last video.  
- After that,  Metamask is going to send the signed transaction to the Ethereum blockchain. 
- A dApp doesn't have to only interface with Metamask,  and it can also interface with all kinds of wallets,  such as hardware wallets. Hardware wallets don't have a connection to the internet,  so your front-end will have to take care of sending the transaction itself.  But that's a special case.

 Most dApps primarily interface with a browser wallet,  like Metamask. <font color="#92d050"> Once a transaction has been mined on the Ethereum network,  the wallet will provide what we call a transaction hash.  That's an identifier for the transaction,  and that will allow users to verify that the transaction was actually mined by using a tool called a blockchain explorer.</font>  I will talk more of blockchain explorer later in this course. 
 
  And finally,  one last piece of the puzzle is the backend. For most dApps,  the backend only purpose is to serve the front-end.  But in some advanced cases,  it's also possible to build a backend that interface with the smart contract.  In general,  it's for caching some data from the smart contract and making it easier for the front-end to read some blockchain data.  For our course,  we won't build dApps with the backend.  We will keep everything in the front-end and in the smart contract. 
  
   We'll stop here,  and in the next video,I will explain what is the development process of a decentralized application.
